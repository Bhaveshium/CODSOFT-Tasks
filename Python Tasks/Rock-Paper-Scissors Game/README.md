<h1 align="center" id="title">Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h1>

<p id="description">The Python Rock-Paper-Scissors Game project aims to recreate the classic hand game in a digital form. It provides an engaging way for users to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game will have a user-friendly command-line interface and will allow players to compete against the computer by selecting their moves.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Game Mechanics: Players can choose either Rock Paper or Scissors as their move and the computer will randomly select its move. The winner is determined based on the game rules: Rock crushes Scissors Scissors cuts Paper and Paper covers Rock.
*   User Input: The application will prompt the user to input their move (Rock Paper or Scissors) through the command line.
*   Computer Move: The computer's move will be generated randomly using Python's random module.
*   Game Outcome: After both the player and computer have chosen their moves the game outcome (win lose or tie) will be displayed.
*   Score Tracking: The application will keep track of the player's and computer's scores throughout the game.
*   Multiple Rounds: Players can choose to play multiple rounds and the scores will accumulate across rounds.
